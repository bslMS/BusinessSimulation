<p><em>OutflowDynamicStock</em> can be used to model the outflow from a stock with inherent dynamic behavior (e.g., a conveyor or a higher-order delay). In these cases, the stock will set the flow and \"signal\" it via its &rarr;<a href=\"modelica://BusinessSimulation.Interfaces.Connectors.StockPort_Special\">StockPort_Special</a>.
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Since neither negative outflows (after all, this is a unidirectional flow) nor preventing an outflow by \"stock control\" (e.g., the receiving stock at <code>portB</code> has <code>stopInflow = true</code>) are compatible with this flow element, the following <code>assert</code> conditions will have breaches of these conditions cause errors that will stop the simulation:</p>
<pre>assert(portA.rate &gt;= 0, \"Rate of outflow must never be negative\");<br>assert(not portB.stopInflow, \"There must not be capacity restrictions (stopInflow) for the stock at portB\");</pre>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>OutflowDynamicStock</code> flow will not observe the <code>stopInflow</code> flag of a stock connected to the B-side port. This means that the receiving stock must have sufficient capacity for the matter flowing out and capacity restrictions have to be imposed by an explicit control structure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To model a fractional outflow from a dynamic stock, <code>SplitOutflowDynamicStock</code> should be used.</li><br>
<li>To model a \"leak\" <code>SplitOutflowDynamicStock</code> can be used with some fraction of the outflow being directed into a &rarr;<a href=\"modelica://BusinessSimulation.SourcesOrSinks.Cloud\">Cloud</a>.</li>
